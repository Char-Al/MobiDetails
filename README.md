# MobiDetails
MobiDetails is a webapp which intends to agregate data on DNA variants in order to help with the interpretation of those variants

It consists in a website where users can easily create variants and retrieve many information.

It will also include an API for programmatic access.

It is currently under intense development and I hope to release a first version in the coming weeks.
